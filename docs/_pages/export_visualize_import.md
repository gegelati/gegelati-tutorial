The objective of this tutorial is to experiment with the DOT file format supported in <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Gegelati</span> to export trained Tangled Program Graphs (TPGs), to visualize their topology, and to import them back in a program.

The following topics are covered in this tutorial:
* Use of the `File::TPGGraphDotExporter` class to serialize pre-trained TPGs into DOT files.
* Visualization of TPG structure evolution throughout the training process using a DOT viewer.
* Creation of an inference-only executable using TPG graphs imported with the `File::TPGGraphDotImporter` class.

The starting point of this tutorial is the C++ project obtained at the end of the _[GEGELATI introductory tutorial](/gegelati-tutorial)_. While completing the introductory tutorial is strongly advised, a copy of the project resulting from this tutorial can be downloaded at the following link: [pendulum_wrapper_solution.zip](/gegelati-tutorial/data/gegelati-tutorial-solution.zip).

## 0. Export TPGs into DOT files.

### The DOT format

### Export TPGs throughout training

### Export the best TPG

## 1. Visualization of TPG graphs.

## 2. Standalone inference from imported DOT file.

### Creation of a new executable in the CMake project.

### Importing TPG for inference.
